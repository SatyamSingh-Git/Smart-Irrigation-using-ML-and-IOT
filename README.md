# ðŸŒ± Smart Irrigation System Using Machine Learning & IoT

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **smart irrigation system** that uses **Machine Learning (ML) and IoT** to predict the optimal time for activating the water pump based on **temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and crop type**. 

The system helps in **water conservation** and **efficient farming** by ensuring crops receive the right amount of water at the right time.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Automated Irrigation**: Predicts when to turn the pump ON/OFF based on real-time sensor data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays sensor data and irrigation status on a web interface.
- **IoT Integration**: Uses ESP8266 microcontroller, DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, and soil moisture sensor.
- **Data Logging**: Stores sensor readings for historical analysis and optimization.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **IoT Components**: ESP8266, DHT11, Soil Moisture Sensor
- **Web Interface**: PHP, MySQL
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Model
The ML model predicts whether irrigation is required using the following classifiers:

| Algorithm        | Accuracy |
|-----------------|----------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | 99% |
| Decision Tree (DT) | 100% |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 64% |

## ðŸ“Œ System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Sensors capture **temperature, humidity, and soil moisture** data.
2. **Data Processing**: Collected data is preprocessed and stored in a database.
3. **ML Prediction**: The model predicts if irrigation is needed.
4. **Irrigation Control**: The **water pump** is turned ON/OFF based on ML predictions.
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Users can view live data and irrigation status via a web interface.
